Run genDataset.m to generate dataset. 

Script assumes a folder named "crop_drinks_dataset" exists in the parent directory that has all the sharp images.

This script generates a dataset of the following structure: 
	crops_drinks_dataset/ -> cropped images. naming: c_im#
	blur_drinks_dataset/ -> 4 blurry images per image. naming: im98_b1, im98_b2, im99_b1, im_99_b2
	kernels_dataset -> 4 kernels per image. naming: im98_k1, im98_k2, im99_k1, im_99_k2
	kernels_normalized_dataset -> normalized by highest value. For viewing purposes
	stack_drinks_dataset/ -> stacks of 15 Wiener deconvolved versions of a blurry image. naming: im98_ws1, im98_ws2, im99_ws1, im99_ws2


crop_drinks_dataset currently contains a subset of the dataset used. For complete dataset, please see Google Drive links provided.
