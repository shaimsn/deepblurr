Run demoRandomMotionBlur.m to generate dataset. 

Script assumes a folder named "crop_drinks_dataset" exists in the parent directory that has all the sharp images.

This script generates two folders: 
	/blur_drinks_dataset  -> includes blurred versions of each image. 4 blurred 					 versions per image
	/kernels_dataset      -> includes kernels used to blur each image. 4 kernels per 				 image
