computational_deblurr.m uses computational imaging techniques to deblurr an given noisy blurred image. 

It uses three methods:
	1) Wiener Filtering Optimization
	2) Richardson-Lucy (R-L) Optimization
	3) Richardson-Lucy (R-L) Optimization with Total Variation (TV) Prior


The file is divided into 5 sections:
	1) Title
	2) Setup
	3) Wiener Optimization
	4) R-L Optimization
	5) R-L Optimization with TV Prior 

Please run one section at a time. To do so on a Mac, click on a section and press cmd+enter.

Results for each algorithm will be displayed as figures.

Feel free to change the tested image.
